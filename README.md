## What is lw3-cli?

**lw3-cli** is a micro CLI that makes the life of web3 developers easier who use hardhat in the backend and next.js in the frontend.
To set up a project using hardhat in the backend and next.js in the frontend we need a bunch of dependencies to get installed and some of the essential common code required in every common project for both hardhat and next.js repetitively.
This is why **lw3-cli** is made to avoid these kinds of repetition to save time consumption that we are able to spend more time on core functionality instead of doing the same thing over and over.
